# Customer Analysis — Portfolio Project

**Tech:** MS SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Power BI, DAX

## Overview
This project analyzes a customer dataset (demographics, income, car ownership, purchase dates) to produce actionable insights and a Power BI dashboard.

## Contents
- `SQL/` — basic and advanced SQL queries (window functions, joins, derived tables)
- `Python/` — Jupyter notebook for EDA and data cleaning
- `PowerBI/` — Power BI dashboard (.pbix or screenshots)
- `Data/` — sample/anonymous dataset (if included)

## Key Analyses & Visuals
- KPI Cards: Total Customers, Average Income, Average Age
- Gender distribution (bar chart)
- Marital status vs TotalChildren (stacked bar)
- Geography map of customers
- First purchase trend (line chart by month/year)
- Income vs Number of Cars Owned (scatter)

## How to run
1. Open `SQL/basic_queries.sql` and run against the `DimCustomer` table to reproduce initial queries.
2. Open `Python/customer_EDA.ipynb` to view data cleaning and EDA steps.
3. Open `PowerBI/customer_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to view interactive dashboard (or view screenshots in `/PowerBI/screenshots`).

## Notes
- Personal data (email, phone, addresses) removed/obfuscated for privacy.
- If `.pbix` is large, it is stored using Git LFS or available via Power BI Service link.
